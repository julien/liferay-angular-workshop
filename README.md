# liferay-angular-workshop

This repository contains examples of 
- Liferay angular portlets created using the liferay-bundle-generator and liferay-npm-bundler
- Creating a shared module that provides npm dependencies across multiple modules
- How to update routing to adapt with Liferay
- An application to acess Liferay's remote rest services


The master branch contains examples using the liferya-bundle-generator and the frontend-js-portlet-extender. This will work with new releases of Liferay 7.1 CE or DXP

If you are using Liferay 7.0, please look at the branch npm-portlets to see compatible examples. This doesnt use the frontend-js-portlet-extender.
